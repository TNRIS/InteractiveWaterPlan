            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>
              Development of the state water plan is central to the mission of the TWDB.  Based on 16 regional water plans, the plan addresses the needs of all water user groups in the state &ndash; municipal, irrigation, manufacturing, livestock, mining, and steam-electric power &ndash; during a repeat of the drought of record that the state suffered in the 1950s.  The regional and state water plans consider a 50-year planning horizon: 2010 through 2060.
            </p>

            <p>During each five-year planning cycle, planning groups evaluate:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>population projections,</li>
              <li>water demand projections, and</li>
              <li>existing water supplies that would be available during times of drought.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Planning groups identify:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>water user groups that will not have enough water during times of drought, and</li>
              <li>recommend strategies that could be implemented to address shortages.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              At the end of each five-year regional water planning cycle, agency staff compiles information from the approved <a href="http://www.twdb.state.tx.us/waterplanning/rwp/plans/index.asp" title="Regional Water Plans">regional water plans</a> and other sources to develop the state water plan, which is presented to TWDB's governing Board for adoption. The final adopted plan is then submitted to the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and the Texas Legislature.
            </p>

            <p>
              The <a href="http://www.twdb.state.tx.us/waterplanning/swp/2012/index.asp" title="2012 State Water Plan">2012 State Water Plan</a> is the ninth state water plan and the third plan based on the regional water planning process. In addition to incorporating the regional water plans, the state water plan serves as a guide to state water policy.

            <h5 id="water-demand">WATER DEMAND</h5>
            <p>

            <p>
              Identified user or group of users for which water demands and water supplies have been identified and analyzed and plans developed to meet water needs. Water user groups are defined at the county level for the manufacturing, irrigation, livestock, steam-electric power generation, and mining water use categories. Municipal water user groups include (a) incorporated cities and selected Census Designated Places with a population of 500 or more; (b) individual or groups of selected water utilities serving smaller municipalities or unincorporated areas; and (c) rural areas not included in a listed city or utility, aggregated for each county.

            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
              This website is a product of the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB). This project is part of our ongoing efforts to communicate information from the 2012 State Water Plan to planners, scientists, policy makers, and the public.
            </p>
            <p>
              TWDB is charged by the Texas Legislature with administering the regional water planning process and developing a state water plan every five years. The data presented are the result of that process and are based on the expertise of numerous people and organizations throughout the state of Texas who participated in development of the 2011 Regional Water Plans and the 2012 State Water Plan, including the more than 400 regional water planning group members, consultants, and administrative agencies; staff of the TWDB; Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, Texas Department of Agriculture, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, and other state and federal agencies; and the individuals and organizations that provided public input during the planning process.
            </p>

            <h3>How Do We Plan?</h3>
            <p>
              Water planning in Texas starts at the regional level with 16 regional water planning groups, one for each of the 16 designated planning areas in the state. Each planning group consists of about 20 members who represent at least 12 interests, as required  by Texas statute, including agriculture, industry, public, environment, municipalities, business, water districts, river authorities, water utilities, counties, power generation, and groundwater management areas.
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="/images/iswp.jpg" alt="Interactive 2012 Texas State Water Plan" class="graphic img-responsive"/>
            </div>
            <p>
              During each five-year planning cycle, planning groups evaluate population projections, water demand projections, and existing water supplies that would be available during times of drought. Planning groups identify water user groups that will not have enough water during times of drought, recommend strategies that could be implemented to address shortages, and estimate the costs of these strategies. While carrying out these tasks, planning groups assess risks and uncertainties in the planning process and evaluate potential impacts of water management strategies on the state's water, agricultural, and natural resources.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the planning groups adopt their regional water plans, they are sent to the TWDB - the state's water supply planning and financing agency - for approval. TWDB then compiles the state water plan, which serves as a guide to state water policy, with information from the regional water plans and policy recommendations to the Texas Legislature. Each step of the process is open to the public and provides numerous opportunities for public input.
            </p>
