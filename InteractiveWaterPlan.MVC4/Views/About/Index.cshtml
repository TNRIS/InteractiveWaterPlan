<h2 id="AboutUs">About Us</h2>
<p>
  This website is a product of the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) Office of Water Resources Planning and Information. This project is part of our ongoing efforts to communicate information from the 2012 State Water Plan to planners, scientists, policy makers and the public.
</p>
<p>
  The Texas Water Development Board is charged by the Texas Legislature with administering the regional water planning process and developing a State Water Plan every five years. The data presented is the result of that process and the expertise of numerous people and organizations throughout the state of Texas who participated in development of the 2011 Regional Water Plans and the 2012 State Water Plan including: the more than 400 regional water planning group members, consultants, and administrative agencies; staff of the TWDB; Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, Texas Department of Agriculture, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, and other state and federal agencies; and the individuals and organizations that provided public input during the planning process. 
</p>

<h3>How Do We Plan?</h3>
<p>
  Water planning in Texas starts at the regional level with 16 regional water planning groups, 1 for each of the 16 designated planning areas in the state. Each planning group consists of about 20 members that represent at least 12 interests, as required by Texas statute, including <strong>Agriculture, Industry, Public, Environment, Municipalities, Business, Water Districts, River Authorities, Water Utilities, Counties, Power Generation, and Groundwater Management Areas.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  During each five-year planning cycle, planning groups evaluate population projections, water demand projections, and existing water supplies that would be available during times of drought. Planning groups identify water user groups that will not have enough water during times of drought, recommend strategies that could be implemented to address shortages, and estimate the costs of these strategies. While carrying out these tasks, planning groups assess risks and uncertainties in the planning process and evaluate potential impacts of water management strategies on the state's water, agricultural, and natural resources. 
</p>
<p>
  Once the planning groups adopt their regional water plans, they are sent to the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) â€” the state's water supply planning and financing agency - for approval. TWDB then compiles the state water plan, which serves as a guide to state water policy, with information from the regional water plans and policy recommendations to the Texas Legislature. Each step of the process is open to the public and provides numerous opportunities for public input.

<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<p>
  All data presented are based on the sixteen 2011 Regional Water Plans and the 2012 State Water Plan. The water planning data are based on the Regional Water Planning Data Application used to collect data from the regional water planning groups.
</p>
<p>
  Summaries of the data presented were published in the <a href="http://www.twdb.state.tx.us/waterplanning/swp/2012/" title="2012 State Water Plan">2012 State Water Plan</a>.
